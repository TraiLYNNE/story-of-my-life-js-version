## App Description

Welcome to Story of My Life.

This app is a web version of a journal for everyday writing. 
Each year is based on a book. There is a quote attached to each book which highlights the theme of the year.
Each month is a chapter of the book. Included in each chapter is the main focus for the month, whether it be school, health, family, etc. A chapter also comes with the creation of important dates. These can be any date important to the user including birthdays, holidays, and appointments.
Each day is a page, where the page is automatically calculated as the number of the day of the year. (e.g. December 31 is Page 365). On each day a quote is added that inspired the user as well as listing something the user is thankful for and a lesson they have learned that day. Multiple tasks are added to each day that the user intends or has completed. Multiple entries are also added to each day. The entries are titled based on the time they were created and include a mood and content.
